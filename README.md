# Project: IEEE754 Floating-Point Adder

---

### Project Description

This project involves creating a floating-point adder that adheres to the IEEE754 standard. The adder can handle both normalized and denormalized operands, as well as special cases such as NaN (Not a Number) and Infinity.  
It is implemented using a pipelined architecture.  
The component has been tested using appropriate test benches to ensure its correct operation in various scenarios.
